## Pending

### [MED] /group-buys — seed CTA points at a 404 vendor URL (user jot)
- pass: user-jot (commit 593b1f9)
- viewport: both
- category: data
- auth_state: anonymous
- observation: On https://thock-coral.vercel.app/group-buys the only seed group buy ("Mode Sonnet R2") renders a "view at vendor" CTA pointing to https://cannonkeys.com/products/mode-sonnet-r2 — which is not a valid product page on the vendor's site. First impressions of /group-buys break immediately when the user clicks the only available link.
- suggested fix: open the seed record at `data/group-buys/cannonkeys-mode-sonnet-r2.json` and either (a) replace the `url` with a real CannonKeys product page (verify with a HEAD probe) or (b) reframe this seed as `status: announced` with no product URL until R2 actually drops. While we're in the file, audit the other URL fields (`imageUrl` is null — fine for now). Same audit pass should add a `data:link-rot` step to the smoke walker (post-MVP) so future seed entries can't ship a dead vendor URL silently.

### [x] [MED] /tag/[slug] — pillar stub advertises "N articles" but renders zero cards (resolved by phase 12)
- addressed in: phase 12 (pending commit)
- pass: 1 (commit 16b53c3 — narrowed to /tag from broader /news+/tag finding 2026-05-09)
- root cause: at filing time, `/tag/[slug]` was a phase-4 stub with the count text but no article list. Phase 12 replaces the stub with the canonical tag page — categorical-tinted header + chronological article list + JSON-LD CollectionPage/ItemList. Empty tags now render a clear "no articles tagged X yet" panel rather than a misleading count.


### [x] [MED] /trends/tracker — first row collides with the table header (user jot)
- addressed in: pending commit (this tick)
- pass: user-jot (commit 285e423)
- root cause: `<TrackerRow>` had `first:pt-0 first:border-t-0` to clean up standalone use, but inside `<TrackerTable>` the header row sits directly above the first body row. Zeroing the first row's top padding made "01 Gateron Oil King" sit flush against the header label cells with no breathing room.
- fix: drop `first:pt-0` from the TrackerRow grid className. The first row now keeps its `py-4` (16px) top padding, giving clear separation from the header. `first:border-t-0` stays so the row's top border doesn't double up against the header's `border-b`.
- regression guard: new e2e in `apps/e2e/tests/trends.spec.ts` asserts the first row's computed `padding-top` is greater than 8px at desktop width.

### [x] [MED] /news — pillar advertises "1 article" but renders zero cards (resolved by phase 7)
- addressed in: phase 7 (commit 80a0290)
- pass: 1 (commit 16b53c3)
- root cause: at filing time, `/news` was a phase-4 PageStub with no article list. Phase 7 replaced it with the canonical pillar landing (PillarHero + ArticleCard hero + PillarArchiveList). curl confirms `hero-card` testid renders. The /tag/[slug] half of this finding is split into a separate Pending row above; phase 12 closes it.

### [x] [HIGH] Tag chips like "#ALICE" read as person names to first-time visitors
- addressed in: pending commit (this tick)
- pass: 1 (filed via /oversight 2026-05-09 from user observation)
- root cause: `<TagChip>` rendered just the slug (`#alice`) with no category context, so first-time readers saw a name-shaped string and had no way to know "alice" referenced a layout style, not a person.
- fix: `packages/ui/src/TagChip.tsx` now prefixes typed-category chips with their category label (`layout · alice`, `switch · linear`, `brand · gmk`). Misc-category chips keep the legacy `#name` form since there's no useful prefix. The categorical color tint per `decisions.jsx` is unchanged. `aria-label` is set to a more legible `"layout tag: Alice"` format. A `data-category` attribute is exposed for downstream styling.
- regression guard: updated unit suite in `packages/ui/src/__tests__/TagChip.test.tsx` (8 tests) covers the new prefix shape, the misc-category fallback, the data-category attribute, and the aria-label format. Existing ArticleTagRail test still passes — it grepped on `unknown-tag` substring which the new shape preserves for misc.
- non-fix: tag-rail glossary block (the critique suggested a one-line tag-rail explainer) deferred — the prefix already clears up confusion at the chip level; a separate glossary would duplicate context and add visual noise.

### [x] [HIGH] mobile nav — primary links unreachable at 375px, no toggle
- addressed in: pending commit (this tick)
- pass: 1 (commit 16b53c3)
- root cause: the desktop nav was `hidden md:flex` and there was no `<md` toggle, so the 5 pillar links were entirely unreachable on phones. Phase 16 listed this as polish scope; pulled forward at user direction.
- fix: new client component `apps/web/src/components/ui/MobileNav.tsx` renders a hamburger toggle visible only at `<md` and a slide-down drawer holding the 5 pillar links. Drawer closes on link click, on Escape, and when the viewport widens past `md`. `Header.tsx` stays a server component and embeds the client `<MobileNav />` next to the search affordance; the desktop nav is unchanged.
- regression guard: new mobile e2e at `apps/e2e/tests/mobile/nav.mobile.spec.ts` opens the drawer at 375px, verifies all 5 pillar links are present, and asserts clicking one routes to `/news`. Five unit tests in `apps/web/src/components/ui/__tests__/MobileNav.test.tsx` cover the open/close state, link rendering, and toggle aria-expanded.

### [x] [MED] every page — `<title>` duplicates the site name
- addressed in: pending commit (this tick)
- pass: 1 (commit 16b53c3)
- root cause: `packages/seo/src/buildMetadata.ts` was suffixing the title (`"News — thock"`) and `apps/web/src/app/layout.tsx` then applied its `title.template = "%s — thock"` on top, yielding `"News — thock — thock"`. The root segment (`/`) was inconsistent because Next.js skips the layout's template for the root page itself, so home rendered with a single suffix while every nested route doubled.
- fix: switch buildMetadata to return `title: { absolute: "<title> — thock" }` so Next.js skips the template entirely. The suffix now appears exactly once on every route, root or nested. OG / Twitter title slots stay fully suffixed (the template never applied there).
- regression guard: new e2e test in `apps/e2e/tests/article.spec.ts` walks `/`, `/news`, `/article/<slug>`, `/trends/tracker`, `/tag/<slug>` and asserts each `<title>` contains exactly one `— thock`. Updated unit test in `packages/seo/src/__tests__/buildMetadata.test.ts` checks the `{ absolute }` shape.

### [x] [HIGH] /article/gateron-oil-king-deep-dive — `[unknown part:oil-king]` placeholder leaks into article prose
- addressed in: pending commit (this tick)
- pass: 1 (commit 16b53c3)
- root cause: `PartReference` (`packages/content/src/mdx/PartReference.tsx`) resolves an article's `mentionedParts` via `parts ?? (article ? getReferencedParts(article) : [])`. The shared `mdxComponents` map registered the component with neither prop bound, so `parts` was always undefined and `article` was always undefined — every `<PartReference id="…">` fell through to the `[unknown part:<id>]` fallback. The seed article frontmatters did contain the right `mentionedParts` rows; the resolver just never saw them.
- fix: `apps/web/src/components/article/ArticleBody.tsx` now accepts a `parts: ResolvedPart[]` prop and builds a per-render components map that wraps `PartReference` with the parts list closured in. The article page route already computes `parts = getReferencedParts(article)` for the MentionedPartsRail; piping the same list to ArticleBody costs nothing extra.
- regression guard: new e2e test in `apps/e2e/tests/article.spec.ts` walks both `/article/gateron-oil-king-deep-dive` and `/article/beginners-switch-buying-guide`, asserts the body never contains the literal string `"[unknown part:"`, and confirms the resolved part name (`Oil King`) appears in the prose.

### [x] [HIGH] /article/* — inline `<Mono>` spans render as block siblings (root cause: missing prose styles)
- addressed in: pending commit (this tick)
- pass: 1 (commit 16b53c3)
- root cause (revised): the live HTML actually rendered `<span class="font-mono">` correctly inline within `<p>`. The visual was caused by Tailwind preflight resetting `p { margin: 0 }` and `.thock-prose` having zero declared rules — adjacent paragraphs collapsed against each other, which made surrounding mono tokens appear stranded. Fix: declare `.thock-prose p` margin in `apps/web/src/styles/components.css` plus matching rules for `ul`, `ol`, `li`, `blockquote`, `hr`, `strong`. New regression-guard e2e (`article.spec.ts`) asserts (a) first body `<p>` has `margin-bottom > 8px` and (b) the "five categories" paragraph contains all five mono tokens within the same `<p>`.

### [x] [HIGH] /article/trends-tracker-preview — body content renders as walls of text where it should be lists
- addressed in: pending commit (this tick) — same root cause as the inline-Mono finding
- pass: 1 (filed via /oversight 2026-05-09 from user observation)
- root cause: identical to the [x] above — `.thock-prose` had no styles, so bold-led paragraphs (`**Name.** ...`, `**Type.** ...`) collapsed into a single visual block. Fix: prose-paragraph margin in components.css. The "What we're tracking" h2's mt-12 was already in place via the SerifH2 mdxComponent — what the user perceived as "no top margin" was actually the wall-of-text effect immediately below it making the heading look glued to the next paragraph.
- follow-up: the user's #ALICE-tag-chip-confusion observation (HIGH, separate finding above) still stands; addressed in a future tick.
